# Polycode-SkeletonSurvival
A simple game made in Polycode (FOSS Game Engine).

## How to install
You'll need the Polycode game engine installed on your computer (http://polycode.org/).

Simply clone this repository or download it as a .zip file and extract it anywhere on your computer; then open "SkeletonSurvival.polyproject" in Polycode. This is the entire project (Assets and Scripts!).

## How to play
This is a simple game to test the Physics 2D Joint mechanics of Polycode. To play, use the keyboard arrows to control the little skeleton on-screen. Up arrow makes it "fly", but be careful, as it uses energy from the energy-bar located on the left (that replenishs over time). Try to avoid the Wraths enemies that appear from the side for as long as you can, before they throw you out of the stage (it's actually quite easy to play forever though, haha).
